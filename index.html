							<h1>Hi! I'm Josha &#128075;</h1>
							<p class="major">I am a senior at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a> studying bioinformatics (BMEG) with a minor in commerce. I'm currently interning as a software developer at <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/">Triumf</a>.
								After that, I will be joining <a href="https://www.relic.com/">Relic Entertainment</a> as an associate programmer for a 4 month co-op, starting in January 2022!
							</p>	
							<p class="major">	
								So far I've gotten lots of fullstack experience at Triumf, but from Relic and onward I will be focusing on just backend positions. I'm currently open to internships for summer 2022! &#128516;

							<h2>Rust Operating System (WIP)</h2>
							<p>Inspired by this <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/">blog</a>, I've been following along building a minimal operating system. This includes building a Rust binary, 
							a minimal kernel, VGA text mode, etc. all written in Rust, with no use of any other OS. This has been a super cool learning experience so far!

							<h2>Find Stuff (WIP)</h2>
							<p>Back when I was a residence advisor for UBC, a concern I kept hearing from first year students was how hard it was to get from class to class
								since they had to look up each building individually and then route to it. The UBC campus is massive, so I totally understand how easy it can be to get lost.
							</p>
							<p>
								My thought with this project was to make it as easy as possible for incoming freshmen to find stuff on campus. All they have to do is type in the course codes
								of all their classes, and the app automatically routes them between every course in order of their occurence. If there is a gap between classes, Find Stuff also recommends
								study spots that are near your last class!
							</p>
							<p>
								I built this app with JS, React, and Node, using my custom UBC API, the Positionstack Geocoding API, and Mapbox GL. I also used material UI for a bunch of the visual things.
								This wildly zoomed out photo doesn't quite do the app justice, so please check out the code <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-campus-nav">here</a> and run it yourself!

							<h2>UBC REST API</h2>
							<p>
								I wanted to make the Find Stuff app for a while, but all the course data for UBC is very inaccessible, and there were no public APIs, so I decided to make this.
								For a comprehensive list of all the endpoints, check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-api">here</a>!
							</p>
							<p>
								I built this API with JS, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I also used Postman for testing, and then deployed it on Heroku.

							<h2>UBC Webscraper</h2>
							<p>
								Before I could make the UBC REST API, I needed all the course data in a good format. I couldn't find any database online that had all the courses in one spot,
								so I had to make a web scraper that navigated between each page and extracted the relevant data, like title, subject, section, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-courses-scraper">here</a>! I made this in Python with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

							<h2>Moonland</h2>
							<p>
								This was just a fun little summer project. I like 8-bit games so I wanted to try to make a simple one. In this game,
								you spawn at a certain position and have to navigate to the final destination planet while avoiding the gravitational pull
								of nearby planets, all while conserving fuel! The thought behind this was that you'd have to utilize the orbital mechanics
								to get to the end, and strategically use fuel, just like they did for the real moon landing.
							</p>
							<p>
								This was made entirely in Python using Pygame and various other Python modules.
							</p>
							<p>
								Clone the <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/moonland">code</a> and give it a shot!

							<h2>MINT Home</h2>
							<p>
								<a href="https://ubcmint.github.io/">MINT</a> is a neurotechnology focused UBC design team, and I was the lead software developer for the MINT Home project.
								Individuals with certain motor disabilities may have extreme difficulty performing tasks such as picking up a remote, or changing
								the channel of a TV. We created a wearable headset that measures brain activity to complete these actions hands-free!
							</p>
							<p>
								On the software team, we designed the app that takes in the raw data, processes it, sends it through an ML model, takes the model output, and sends a signal
								to a devices connected by bluetooth. The user would wear the headset, and think of a certain stimulus, which would then trigger an action, such as turning on a TV, or changing the volume.
							</p>
							<p>
								We made this app with Electron, JS, React, and D3 for the frontend, and a Flask/Python backend. I wish I could link the repo, but
								unfortunately all the code is private since it's being submitted to competitions.
