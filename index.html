							<h1>Hi! I'm Josha &#128075;</h1>

I'm currently interning as a software developer at <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/">Triumf</a>, and I'm searching for my next co-op for January 2021!
								So far I've had lots of fun as a fullstack developer, so I'm open to frontend or backend positions &#128516;

							<h2>Rust Operating System (WIP)</h2>
							<p>Inspired by this <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/">blog</a>, I've been following along building a minimal operating system. This includes building a Rust binary, 
							a minimal kernel, VGA text mode, etc. all written in Rust. This has been a super cool learning experience so far! This isn't a very visual project, so I wasn't sure what
							to use for a photo, so as a placeholder there is a photo of my bunny, Gina üêá

							<h2>Find Stuff (WIP)</h2>
							<p>This was the continuation of my prior two projects (the UBC API and course info webscraper shown below). I have a terrible sense of direction,
								and UBC is a huge campus, and every time I wanted to get to my class I'd have to navigate through the UBC site to find the building name, then put that
								into Maps, and repeat for every course..
							</p>
							<p>
								My thought with this was it could be a easy way for directionally challenged freshmen (like I used to be..) to navigate between classes. Find Stuff also recommends 
								study spots near your course buildings if there are gaps in your timetable! I built this with JS, React, and Node, using my UBC API, Mapbox GL for the map, and the Positionstack Geocoding API. I used material UI
								for a bunch of the visual things too.
							</p>
							<p>
								This wildly zoomed out photo doesn't quite do the app justice, so please check out the code <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-campus-nav">here</a> and run it yourself!

							<h2>UBC REST API</h2>
							<p>
								I wanted to make the Find Stuff app for a while, but all the course data for UBC is very inaccessible, and there were no public APIs, so I decided to make this.
								For a comprehensive list of all the endpoints, check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-api">here</a>!
							</p>
							<p>
								I built this API with JS, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I also used Postman for testing, and then deployed it on Heroku.

							<h2>UBC Webscraper</h2>
							<p>
								Before I could make the UBC REST API, I needed all the course data in a good format. I couldn't find any database online that had all the courses in one spot,
								so I had to make a web scraper that navigated between each page and extracted the relevant data, like title, subject, section, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-courses-scraper">here</a>! I made this in Python with Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

							<h2>Moonland</h2>
							<p>
								This was just a fun little summer project. I like 8-bit games so I wanted to try to make a simple one. In this game,
								you spawn at a certain position and have to navigate to the final destination planet while avoiding the gravitational pull
								of nearby planets, all while conserving fuel! The thought behind this was that you'd have to utilize the natural orbital mechanics
								to get to the end, and strategically use fuel, just like they did for the real moon landing.
							</p>
							<p>
								This was made entirely in Python using Pygame and various other Python modules.
							</p>

								Clone the <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/moonland">code</a> and give it a shot!

							<h2>MINT Home</h2>
							<p>
								<a href="https://ubcmint.github.io/">MINT</a> is a neurotechnology focused UBC design team, and I was the lead software developer for the MINT Home project.
								Individuals with certain motor disabilities may have extreme difficulty performing tasks such as picking up a remote, or changing
								the channel of a TV. We created a wearable headset that measures brain activity to complete these actions hands-free!
							</p>
							<p>
								On the software team, we designed the app that takes in the raw data, processes it, sends it through an ML model, takes the model output, and sends a signal
								to a devices connected by bluetooth. The user would wear the headset, and think of a certain stimulus, which would then trigger an action, such as turning on a TV, or changing the volume.
							</p>
							<p>
								We made this app with Electron, JS, React, and D3 for the frontend, and a Flask/Python backend. I wish I could link the repo, but
								unfortunately all the code is private since it's being submitted to competitions.
