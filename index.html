							<p class="major">I'm a senior at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">UBC</a> studying bioinformatics (BMEG) with a minor in commerce. I finished my work terms as a software developer at <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/">TRIUMF</a>,
								and I'm super excited to be joining <a href="https://www.relic.com/">Relic Entertainment</a> as an associate programmer until April 2022! After that you can catch me at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> as a SDE intern for summer 2022.

							<h2>Rust Operating System (WIP)</h2>
							<p>Inspired by this <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/">blog</a>, I've been following along building a bare metal operating system. This includes building a Rust binary, 
							a minimal kernel, VGA text mode, etc, with no use of any other OS.

							<h2>Find Stuff (WIP)</h2>
							<p>Back when I was a residence advisor for UBC, there were so many complaints from first year students was how hard it was to get from class to class
								since they had to look up each building individually and then route to it. Totally understandable since the UBC campus is huge.
							</p>
							<p>
								With Find Stuff, all you have to do is type in the course codes
								of your classes, and the app automatically routes them between every course in order of their occurence. If there is a gap between classes, Find Stuff also recommends
								study spots that are near your last class!
							</p>
							<p>
								I built this app with JS, React, and Node, using my custom UBC API, the Positionstack Geocoding API, and Mapbox GL. I also used material UI for a bunch of the visual things.
								Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-campus-nav">here</a>.

							<h2>UBC REST API</h2>
							<p>
								Since there were no public APIs for UBC, I had to make my own to build Find Stuff.
								For a comprehensive list of all the endpoints, check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-api">here</a>! I got all this data by building a webscraper with
								Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup, which you can also check out <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/ubc-courses-scraper">here</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								I built this API with JS, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I also used Postman for testing, and then deployed it on Heroku.

							<h2>Moonland</h2>
							<p>
								This was just a fun little summer project. I like 8-bit games so I wanted to try to make a simple one. In this game,
								you spawn at a certain position and have to navigate to the final destination planet while avoiding the gravitational pull
								of nearby planets, all while conserving fuel. The thought behind this was that you'd have to utilize the orbital mechanics
								to get to the end, and strategically use fuel, just like they did for the real moon landing.
							</p>
							<p>
								This was made entirely in Python using Pygame and various other Python modules.
							</p>
							<p>
								Clone the <a href="https://github.com/joshah98/moonland">code</a> and give it a shot :)

							<h2>MINT Home</h2>
							<p>
								<a href="https://ubcmint.github.io/">MINT</a> is a neurotechnology focused UBC design team, and I was the lead software developer for the MINT Home project.
								Individuals with certain motor disabilities may have extreme difficulty performing tasks such as picking up a remote, or changing
								the channel of a TV. We created a wearable headset that measures brain activity to complete these actions hands-free!
							</p>
							<p>
								On the software team, we designed the app that takes in the raw data, processes it, sends it through an ML model, takes the model output, and sends a signal
								to a devices connected by bluetooth. The user would wear the headset, and think of a certain stimulus, which would then trigger an action, such as turning on a TV, or changing the volume.
							</p>
							<p>
								We made this app with Electron, JS, React, and D3 for the frontend, and a Flask/Python backend. I wish I could link the repo, but
								unfortunately all the code is private since it's being submitted to competitions.
